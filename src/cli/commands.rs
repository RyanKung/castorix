🔐 Castorix - Secure Farcaster ENS Integration Tool

A comprehensive command-line tool for managing encrypted private keys, creating ENS domain proofs, 
and interacting with Farcaster Hub. Castorix provides secure key storage with password-based 
encryption, making it safe to store private keys locally while maintaining easy access for 
Farcaster operations.

Key Features:
  • 🔒 Encrypted Private Key Management - Store keys securely with password protection
  • 🌐 ENS Domain Proof Creation - Generate proofs for your ENS domains
  • 📡 Farcaster Hub Integration - Submit proofs and interact with Farcaster
  • 🏷️  Key Aliases - Organize keys with friendly names and descriptions
  • 🔄 Key Management - Rename, update, and manage multiple keys
  • 📁 Custom Storage Path - Specify custom directory for storing encrypted keys

Examples:
  # Generate a new encrypted key
  castorix key generate-encrypted my-wallet "My Main Wallet"
  
  # Import an existing private key
  castorix key import existing-key "Backup Wallet" 0x1234...
  
  # List all your keys
  castorix key list
  
  # Generate an ENS proof (using default key)
  castorix ens proof vitalik.eth 12345
  
  # Generate an ENS proof (using specific encrypted wallet)
  castorix ens proof ryankung.base.eth 460432 --wallet-name my-wallet
  
  # Use custom storage path
  castorix --path /custom/path key generate-encrypted my-wallet "My Wallet"
